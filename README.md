This repository solves elementary level Math problems covering topics like Algebra, Conversion, and Measures of Central Tendency. I have shared both the source file and executable file of the program.

The program consists of 5 different Mathematical operations options:

1.	Function: Consists of domain and range finding algorithms for a linear algebraic-functions

2.	Equations: Consists of factorization algorithms for finding the roots of a quadratic equation and common-solution-algorithms for two simultaneous linear equations

3.	Conversion: Consists of hr:min:sec conversion algorithms for any given time, km:m:cm conversion algorithms for any given distance, and currency conversion algorithms

4.	 Sequence & Series: Consists of common difference, common ratio and nth term finding algorithms for any given Arithmetic progression and Geometric Progression

5.	Arithmetic Mean: Consists of arithmetic mean finding algorithms for given individual, discrete, and continuous series
